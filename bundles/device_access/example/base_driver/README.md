# Base driver

The base driver is a "special" driver that will not be loaded by the device manager.
Normally the device manager will load drivers if it find device which are idle... But before that can happen 
at least one device should exists. This is the role of a base driver and it should function like a "normal" OSGi
bundle which registers a device service.

In this example the base driver will provide two device service with a DEVICE_CATEGORY of "char".
