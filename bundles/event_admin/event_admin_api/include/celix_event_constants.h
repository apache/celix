/**
 * @brief Service registration property specifying the Event topics of interest to an Event Handler service.
 *
 * The Event Handler must use the following grammar to indicate the topics in which it is interested:\n
 * topic-description := '*' | topic ( '/&zwj;*' )?  \n
 * topic := token ( '/' token )*    \n
 *
 * The event handler also can specify multiple topics by providing a comma separated list of topics.
 *
 * @example
 * - "com/acme/&zwj;*"                         Indicates all topics beginning with "com/acme/"   \n
 * - "com/acme/MyEvent"                       Indicates only the specific event which topic is "com/acme/MyEvent"  \n
 * - "*"                                      Indicates all topics   \n
 * - "com/acme/MyEvent,com/acme/MyOtherEvent" Indicates the specific events with topics "com/acme/MyEvent" and "com/acme/MyOtherEvent"
 *
 * @todo Use string array instead of comma-separated list.(depends on https://github.com/apache/celix/issues/674)
