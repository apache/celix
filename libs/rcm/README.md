## Requirement-Capability-Model (RCM) library
C library based on the OSGi Requirement-Capability-Model, part of 
[Chapter 3.3](https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/8.0.0/framework.module.html#framework.module.dependencies)
, [Chapter 6](https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/8.0.0/framework.resource.html)
and [Chapter 7](https://docs.osgi.org/specification/osgi.core/8.0.0/framework.wiring.html)
in the OSGi Core Specification 8.

## Base Requirement-Capability-Model 

The Requirement-Capability-Model (RCM) is a model for describing the capabilities and requirements for a resource.
This model can be used in bundle wiring to resolve the dependencies between bundles.

The following diagram shows the RCM model:
