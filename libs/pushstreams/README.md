# Celix PushStream

Celix PushSteams are based on the OSGI Push Stream Specification (OSGi Compendium Release 7 Specification, Chapter 706).
It follows the specification as close as possible, but some adjustments are mode for C++17.

NOTE: this implementation is still experiment and the api and behaviour will probably still change.
