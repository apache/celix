APACHE CELIX INCUBATION - BUILDING AND INSTALLATION OVERVIEW

Notes
-----

* Currently Apache Celix only builds and works on Unix/Linux like systems
  (including MacOSX).
* Apache Celix requires CMake for building, other requirements/dependencies are 
  listed per subproject on http://incubator.apache.org/celix/subprojects.html
* More information about the build system, and how to extend it, can be found at
  the website: http://incubator.apache.org/celix/documentation.html
	
	
Quick Start
-----------

  # Create a build directory next to the celix source directory
  $ mkdir celix-build; cd celix-build
  $ ccmake ../celix
  
  # Enable/Disable the required sub projects (BUILD_{NAME} entries)
  # Optionally, enable advanced mode (t) and change CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
  # Run Configure (might be needed multiple times)
  # Run Generate (this also returns to the shell)
  $ make
  
  # To deploy the included examples
  $ make deploy
  # Navigate to <subproject>/deploy/<deployname>
  $ sh run.sh
  
  # To install the release (framework, headers and bundles)
  $ make install-release
  
  # To see a list of all available targets
  $ make help

  
Unit testing using CppUTest
---------------------------

Apache Celix has two build options that enable a set of unit tests. These tests
are based on CUnit a fork of CppUTest. CUnit can simply be installed and is normally
found by the CMake scripts, but for CppUTest a fork needs to be build.

The fork can be found on https://github.com/abroekhuis/cpputest. Simply cloning, building
and updating the build configuration to point to the build files should be enough.

Some background, CppUTest doesn't support output parameters, but Celix's API relies heavily
on those. The fork adds support for this.


Background information
----------------------

Apache Celix uses CMake to generate the build files needed for compilation.
deployment and installation.

* CMake (http://www.cmake.org)
  CMake generated build files based on specific CMake files. To setup a build
  a console (ccmake) and GUI (cmake-gui) method is provided. With these editors
  include paths, installation prefix etc can be changed.
  CMake stores the configuration in a cache, which is used during the build.
  To keep the cache/build files separate from the source, a out-of-source build
  is preferred. To start from scratch, the build directory can be deleted and
  new build files can be generated.
* Apache Celix Subprojects
  Since Apache Celix provides a modular framework, it makes sense to provide the
  available components as modules as well. To enable/disable these modules cmake
  is used. In the GUI or console there are settings named BUILD_{NAME} which can
  be switched on or off. On http://incubator.apache.org/celix/subprojects.html a
  list of all subprojects is given.
* Apache Celix deployment/installation
  With a modular system it doesn't make sense to simply install everything to
  the file system. Depending on the needs different version/modules can be 
  needed.
  To cater for this, Celix provides deployment support which takes care of 
  copying the required bundles to a named target. A basic run script is 
  created as well.
  Installing the framework (and its dependencies) might make sense, every target
  needs the framework. To install only the framework a dedicated target is 
  available: make install-release.
