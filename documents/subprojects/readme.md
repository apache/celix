#Apache Celix - Subprojects

Apache Celix is organized into several subprojects. The following subproject are currently available:

* [Framework](../../framework) - The Apache Celix framework, an implementation of OSGi adapted to C.
* [Dependency Manager](../../dependency_manager) - A C component/dependency model for use through an API provided as library.
* [C++ Dependency Manager](../../dependency_manager_cxx) - A C++ component/dependency model for use through an API provided as library.
* [Device Access](../../device_access) - An implementation of the OSGi Device Access specification adapted to C.
* [Etcd library](../../etcdlib) - A C library that interfaces with ETCD. 
* [Examples](../../examples) - A Selection of examples showing how the framework can be used.
* [Log Service](../../log_service) - An implementation of the OSGi Log Service adapated to C.
* [Log Writer](../../log_writer) - A simple log writer for use in combination with the Log Service.
* [Remote Service Admin](../../remote_services) - An implementation of the OSGi Remote Service Admin Service - for several protocols - adapted to C.
    * [Remote Service Admin HTTP](../../remote_services/remote_service_admin_http) - A HTTP implementation of the RSA.
    * [Remote Service Admin DFI](../../remote_services/remote_service_admin_dfi) - A Dynamic Function Interface (DFI) implementation of the RSA.
    * [Remote Service Admin SHM](../../remote_services/remote_service_admin_shm) - A shared memory implementation of the RSA.
    * [Topology Manager](../../remote_services/topology_manager) - A (scoped) RSA Topology Manager implementation.
