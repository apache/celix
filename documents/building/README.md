# Building and Installing Apache Celix
Apache Celix aims to be support a broad range of UNIX platforms.
 
Currently, the [continuous integration build server] builds and tests Apache Celix for:

* Ubuntu Focal Fossa (20.04)
  * GCC
  * CLang
* Ubuntu Jammy Jellyfish (22.04)
  * GCC 
  * CLang 
* OSX
  * CLang


### Download the Apache Celix sources
To get started you first have to download the Apache Celix sources. This can be done by cloning the Apache Celix git repository:

```bash
#clone the repro
git clone --single-branch --branch master https://github.com/apache/celix.git
```

## Building and installing
Apache Celix can be build using [Conan](https://conan.io) as package manager/build system or by directly using
[CMake](https://cmake.org).

### Building Apache Celix using Conan
The following packages (libraries + headers) should be installed on your system:

* Development Environment
    * build-essentials (gcc/g++ or clang/clang++) 
    * java or zip (for packaging bundles)
    * make (3.14 or higher)
    * git
    * cmake (3.19 or higher)
    * Conan (2 or higher)

For Ubuntu 22.04, use the following commands:
```bash
sudo apt-get install -yq --no-install-recommends \
    build-essential \
    cmake \
    git \
    default-jdk \
    python3 \
    python3-pip \
    ninja-build
        
#Install conan
pip3 install -U conan   
```

Configure conan default profile using automatic detection of the system
```bash
conan profile detect
```

Create Apache Celix package - and build the dependencies - in the Conan cache:
```bash
cd <celix_source_dir>
conan create . --build missing -o build_all=True   
#Optionally build with CMake->Ninja, instead of CMake->Make. Note this includes building dependencies with Ninja. 
conan create . --build missing -o build_all=True  -c tools.cmake.cmaketoolchain:generator=Ninja 
```

Note installing Apache Celix is not required when using Conan, because Conan will install the Apache Celix package
in the local Conan cache.

It is also possible to only build a selection of the Apache Celix bundles and/or libs. This can be done by providing
build options for the required parts instead of the `build_all=True` option. For example to only build the Apache Celix
framework library and the Apache Celix utils library use the following command:
```bash
conan create . --build missing -o build_framework=True -o build_utils=True
```

To see a complete overview of the available build options use the following command:
```bash
conan inspect . | grep build_
```

#### CMake Private Linking Workaround

When using Celix via Conan, you may encounter an [issue](https://github.com/apache/celix/issues/642) where libzip.so is not found by linker.
This is due to a [bug in Conan](https://github.com/conan-io/conan/issues/7192).

A workaround we adopt in Celix is adding the following to conanfile.py:

```python
    def generate(self):
        deps = CMakeDeps(self)
        deps.generate()
        tc = CMakeToolchain(self)
        # the following is workaround for https://github.com/conan-io/conan/issues/7192
        if self.settings.os == "Linux":
            tc.cache_variables["CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS"] = "-Wl,--unresolved-symbols=ignore-in-shared-libs"
        elif self.settings.os == "Macos":
            tc.cache_variables["CMAKE_EXE_LINKER_FLAGS"] = "-Wl,-undefined -Wl,dynamic_lookup"
        tc.generate()
```

### Building Apache Celix directly using CMake
The following packages (libraries + headers) should be installed on your system:

* Development Environment
    * build-essentials (gcc/g++ or clang/clang++) 
    * java or zip (for packaging bundles)
    * make (3.19 or higher)
    * git
* Apache Celix Dependencies
    * libzip
    * uuid
    * zlib
    * curl (only initialized in the Celix framework)
    * jansson (for serialization in libdfi)
    * libffi (for libdfi)
    * libxml2 (for remote services and bonjour shell)
    * rapidjson (for C++ remote service discovery)
	

For Ubuntu 22.04, use the following commands:
```bash
#### get dependencies
sudo apt-get install -yq --no-install-recommends \
    build-essential \
    cmake \
    git \
    curl \
    uuid-dev \
    libjansson-dev \
    libcurl4-openssl-dev \
    default-jdk \
    libffi-dev \
    libzip-dev \
    libxml2-dev \
    libcpputest-dev \
    rapidjson-dev
```

For OSX systems with brew installed, use the following commands:
```bash
brew update && \
brew install lcov libffi libzip rapidjson libxml2 cmake jansson && \
brew link --force libffi
``` 

Use CMake and make to build Apache Celix
```bash
cd celix
mkdir build
cd build
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo .. 
make -j
```

## Editing Build options
With use of CMake, Apache Celix makes it possible to edit build options. This enabled users, among other options, to configure a install location and select additional bundles.
To edit the options use ccmake or cmake-gui. For cmake-gui an additional package install can be necessary (Fedora: `dnf install cmake-gui`). 

```bash
cd celix/build
ccmake .
#Edit options, e.g. enable BUILD_REMOTE_SHELL to build the remote (telnet) shell
#Edit the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX config to set the install location
```

For this guide we assume the CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX is `/usr/local`.

## Installing Apache Celix

```bash
cd celix/build
make -j
sudo make install
```

## Running Apache Celix
If Apache Celix is successfully installed running
```bash
celix
```
should give the following output:
"Error: invalid or non-existing configuration file: 'config.properties'.No such file or directory".

For more info how to build your own projects and/or running the Apache Celix examples see [Celix Intro](../README.md).
