 Files having a separate license should be ignored.
 For Celix these include
   - Mongoose
   - Civetweb
   - Unzip and MiniZip files
   - Doxygen scripts for CMake (Doxyfile.in, UseDoxygen.cmake)
 
 Also there are several files which can't have a license.
   - *.in Input files used by CMake to generate files for deployment,
          should not contain comments.
  - .project Eclipse project file, not in the release but generated by CMake.
             Excluded to prevent false positives when using RAT on a dev tree.
   
 Todo: Why doesn't RAT exclude these files when using a full path?
cmake/config.properties.in
cmake/run.sh.in
cmake/RunConfig.in

Doxyfile.in

 Workaround to exclude .in files.
