# This Project contains some example how to use Apache Celix,
# including CMake files, C examples and C++ examples.

# To build these example:
# - build and install celix
# - Create a new build project dir and cd to it
# - set the MAKE_FIND_ROOT_PATH to the install location
#   of Celix (e.g. /opt/local) if this is different from
#   /usr or /usr/local
# - cmake <loc_to_celix_src>/examples
# - make -j all
